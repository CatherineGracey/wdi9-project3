# Wire Frames and User Stories

Our wire frames and user stories are available on our Trello board at https://trello.com/b/RkmxO6Qc/project-3-board. All of our users will be job seekers, so user stories were written with this assumption in mind.

# Technologies Used

On the server side we used Ruby on Rails. On the client side we used jQuery, Underscore, Backbone, Handlebars and Materialize.

# Major Hurdles

The biggest challenges our team faced was the abundance of new libraries that we used. Individually no particular library was too challenging, but learning how to use them as we also learned how to incorporate them with each other was quite complicated and pushed us both as individual programmers and as a team.

A secondary challenge, caused partly by the main challenge, was early in the project when our code base was still small. Our early components all relied on each other, which made it impossible to test code that was still being written by another team member. This problem naturally resolved itself as our codebase became larger, allowing each team member to work on a distinct area of the code without delaying other members.
